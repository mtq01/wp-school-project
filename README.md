## GitHub – Instructions


## Step 1 - Clone Repo & Install node_modules Locally
(You might have already done this)

    a. Clone This Repo: https://github.com/mtq01/wp-school-project/
    b. Do NOT create a feature branch yet.
    c. Open your school-project folder in Terminal (or VSCode)
    d. Run npm install

## Step 2 - Create a Feature Branch
(Please _**never**_ code directly on the Main or Staging branches.)

**How to Create a Feature Branch:**

Ensure staging is up to date then create the feature off of that.



    a. Switch to Staging Branch:         git checkout staging
    b. Fetch Changes:                    git fetch --prune
    c. Merge Updates:                    git merge origin/staging
    d. Feature Branch Name Example:      mike/feature/add-api-logic
    e. Create Feature Branch:            git checkout -b yourFirstName/feature/name-of-feature
    
    **Note:** If you aren't sure which branch you're on type: `git branch`

Pushing Your Branch with Upstream:

    a. Add your files:                   `git add .`                               (all files)
                                         `git add index.html css/style.css`        (individual files) 

    b. Descriptive Commit Message:       `git commit -m "a brief explanation of the changes/updates."`
    Note: 
    _    - When making a PR on GitHub, please add a more in depth description of what was changed/updated_

    c. Set Upstream / First Push:        `git push -u origin yourFirstName/feature/name-of-feature`
    Note:                           
        - Required on the FIRST Push of each NEW branch you make.
        - It Links your local branch with a new branch on Github         
                                  
    d. Future Pushes:                    `git push`                                                   
    Note: 
        - After setting the upstream, you can just type the 'git push' command since it's already linked to GitHub

## Step 3 - PULL REQUESTS (PR) on Github

Once you push your feature to GitHub you need to make a PR.

    a. Open GitHub Repo:                 `https://github.com/mtq01/m3-movie-app/tree/main`
    
    b. Select the Base:                  `Change 'main' to 'staging'`
    
    c. Assign Reviewer:                  `On the right side, click the Gear Icon & Select a Team Member`
    
    d. Merging:                          - You can't merge your own PR (A rule was set on GitHub requiring a reviewer)
                                         - Mention your PR to your team member in a DM/Discord
                                         - Wait for the reviewer to 'Approve & Merge' your PR
    
    e. Post Merge:                       - Whoever approves/denies the merge needs to let everyone know ASAP.
                                         - Send a msg using @name on Discord
                                         - Everyone needs to pull the latest changes to ASAP.
                                         - All members need to confirm they pulled the lastest changes.

## Pulling Changes Locally
[IMPORTANT]: When a PR is merged on GitHub, our local feature branches become _"out of date."_ To avoid headaches later, update your active branches immediately. If you are working on multiple features, repeat the Merge and Stash Pop steps for each one.

**STASH**: Moves your uncommitted changes into a temporary storage box so they don't get tangled up or deleted during a merge. It's essentially a local "save" option that's used when you arent ready to commit, but need to save.

**f. Pulling Latest Changes (The Workflow)**

*there are faster ways, but we are doing everything manually step by step to practice Git commands*

- `git stash push -m "Saving work before update"`     (from your feature branch, protects your work before pulling changes!)

- `git checkout staging`                              (switch to your local copy of staging)

- `git fetch --prune`                                 (view changes to staging before merging & prune any deleted branches)

- `git merge origin/staging`                          (updates the code in your staging branch)

- `git checkout your/feature/branch`                  (switch back to the feature you are actually building.)

- `git fetch`                                         (view changes, `--prune` is not needed here bcuz we did that previously)

- `git merge origin/staging`                          (add the fresh server code into your feature branch.)

- `git stash pop`                                     (brings your work back onto the new code from the stash.)

**Key Details**

**fetch:** Reaches out to GitHub and makes a "photocopy" of all team updates. It does not touch your actual code files, making it 100% safe to run anytime.

- Tip: If you have an active feature branch you're working on *(and don't need to create a brand new feature)* you can update the active feature a little faster by following these steps:

- `git stash -m "comment"` 
- `git fetch --prune` 
- `git merge origin/staging`
- `git stash pop`


**--all:** Tells Git to map every single branch on the server, ensuring you don't miss new work from teammates. (technically not needed since we aren't using forks in our repo, but it's still valid)

**--prune:** Cleans up "ghost" branches. If a teammate deleted a branch on GitHub after a merge, this removes it from your local list so it stays clean.

**merge:** Actually combines the "photocopy" (the server code) into your current file.

**origin/staging:** origin is the server (GitHub). By merging origin/staging instead of just staging, you are guaranteed to get the official, clean version of the code.

## Merge Conflicts

1. If you get a merge conflict, dont panic.

2. **Follow these steps (or ask me):**
Pick a winner: VSCode will give you buttons at the top of the conflict:
_   - *Accept Current Change:* Keeps your version.
    - *Accept Incoming Change:* Keeps the staging version. 
    - *Accept Both:* Keeps both (you'll have to clean up the order).
    - *Save and Commit:* Once the scary "red" is gone, save the file, stage it (git add .), and commit the fix._


**Extras (Optional):**                             
_- Peek a specific file in terminal. Handy if you know which file you want to look at. It will print the content of the file directly in terminal withour changing your current workspace:_
                                    
`git show origin/name/feature/name-of-feature:path/to/file.css`

_- Peek what changed. See what was added/removed compared to what you have right now. 'head' is the shortcut   for 'where you are right now', '..' means compare against, and 'origin/staging' is the photocopy of the server you downloaded:_

`git diff HEAD..origin/name/feature/name-of-feature`     (shows all code changes)

_- Alternative ways to "peek" and the differences._

`git diff HEAD..origin/staging --name-only`               (shows the file name changes)
`git log HEAD..origin/staging`                            (shows the list of commits)

_- If the changes are too complex to read in terminal, you can open the files in your editor to see how they work (You can view/edity our collaboraters features, but please dont make changes to your team members code without permission):_

`git checkout origin/name/feature/name-of-feature`

   
   



**g. Delete Merged Branches              (OPTIONAL)**
            Locally                      - `git branch -d yourName/feature/feature-name`       
            Delete on GitHub             - `https://github.com/mtq01/m3-movie-app/branches (click trashcan bside branch)`
            Prune 'Ghost' References     - `git fetch --prune`

            Note: IF we did delete the Branches on GitHub and Locally, we would also need to run the'--prune' command to clean up any 'ghost' references. Our computer still thinks the branch exists until we prune it.
                                         
                                         
**Tips on Deleting a Local Branch:**

a. What if you need to make changes to that feature later on?
    
    If the Pull Request has NOT been merged:
        - You wouldn't delete the branch in the first place because it has not been saved to GitHub.
        - Stay on your branch, make changes as needed, push the new changes are complete and make a new PR.

    If the Pull Request HAS been merged:
        - Don't try to revive the old branch.
        - Switch to the 'staging' branch locally and pull the latest updates.
        - Create a NEW feature branch for the changes:
                git checkout -b yourName/feature/name-of-feature-v2
        - Make your changes, push to GitHub, and open a new pull request to staging.

    The 'Golden Rule' of Branches:
        - You write your idea on a 'sticky-note'.
        - Stick the note on the board (GitHub PR)
        - Once its merged to 'staging' or 'main', you throw the sticky-note away.

## Step 4 - Merging STAGING to MAIN

We only merge from 'staging' to 'main' when we reach a stable milestone. Don't do this without confirming with the team.

    **Stable Milestones: (These are just random Examples)**
        
        1. Minimum Viable Product:
            - Main Page
            - Search Bar Logic          
            - Nav Component             
            - Movie Card Components     
            - Carousel Component
            - Footer Component
            - Social Links              
            - Layout is responsive      (mobile/desktop)
            - Trailer                   
            - API Key securely handled via .env
        
        2. Milestone 2:
            - Clicking a movie card passes the ID to the details page.
            - Details Page              (shows details)
            - Back Button               (works without crashing the app)

        3. Milestone 3:
            - Favorites Page            
            - Favorites Logic           (clicking the fav button adds/removes the movie from the favorites page)
            - Memory                    (movies stay on fav page after the page is resfreshed)
            - Navigation                (add routing between all pages & ensure no errors)
